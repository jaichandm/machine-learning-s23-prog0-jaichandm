# Programming Assignment 0 for Machine Learning Spring 2023
Our initial programming assignment in machine learning

## Introduction
Open the Introduction to Python notebook in the DS-Python repository _URL_ with Jupyter Lab.  Try running the chunks of code and then explore.  The more that you ask questions and try things out the faster you will become comfortable in Python.   As you are playing with the notebook, you should also double click on text sections to expose the MarkDown.  You will be asked to intersperse description and code as we move forward in the course. MarkDown is a handy tool to format text (simpler than HTML).  Also, since it is text based, it will integrate well with git.  Here are some handy online references:

## What to do
Modify the Assignment0 note book by adding in sections to finish the tasks listed.
## Submission
### Process:  There are two parts to this assignment. You will insert code and MarkDown sections where you will put your answers.
### Commit and Push
 Anytime you complete a part, you are required to commit to your local personalized copy of the repository. You will then push to the github repository.  Use good commit messages.  _Points will be deducted if you don't commit for each part._  Note:  It is always acceptable to make a change to a section later. Just remember to commit and push your work.
